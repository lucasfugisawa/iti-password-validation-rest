# @itidigital Backend Challenge: Password Validation API

This is a possible solution to the backend challenge found at: https://github.com/itidigital/backend-challenge

Since I solved the challenge for fun (I didn't apply for the related opportunities), there might be gaps in the implementation of the requirements.

If you have any questions, inquiries, suggestions, critiques, etc., feel free to get in touch with me.
